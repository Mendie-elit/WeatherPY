In this study we randomly selected 610 cities, for each city we gathered weather related data including temperature, humidity, cloudiness and windspeed, then compared these weather factors to the cities proximity to the equator.

Latitude vs. Temperature
As it is still winter in the northern hemisphere most of the cities north of the equator have a max temperature between 20 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit compared to cities on the equator of 80 degrees Fahrenheit.

Latitude vs.  Humidity
Proximity to the equator does not seem to impact humidity levels.  There are cities in each hemisphere as far away as +/- 60 degrees with 100% humidity and cities as close as +/- 20 degrees with less than 20% humidity.  

Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Cloudiness does not seem to impact humidity levels either.  On this day the majority of cities sampled had close to no clouds while most cities had 80% or higher humidity levels.
